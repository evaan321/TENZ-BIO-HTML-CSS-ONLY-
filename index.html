                <p style="letter-spacing: 1.2px; margin-top: 2%; font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 20px;">Ngo's professional career began in October 2019 when he joined Cloud9's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team at the age of 18, making him one of the youngest players in the professional scene at the time.[4] In April 2020, following the public beta release of Riot Games' first-person shooter Valorant, Ngo announced his intention to retire from CS:GO and transition into the new game, making him Cloud9's first professional Valorant player.[5][6]

                    On January 12, 2021, Ngo announced that he would be stepping down from professional Valorant in order to pursue content creation.[7]
                    
                    Following the suspension of Sentinels player Sinatraa due to sexual assault allegations, Cloud9 agreed to loan Ngo to Sentinels in April 2021, marking his return to professional Valorant after a three month absence.[8] The following month, Sentinels went on to defeat Fnatic at the Grand Finals of VCT Masters 2 in Reykjavík, winning the first ever international LAN tournament in Valorant history.[9] On June 2, 2021, Sentinels bought out Ngo's contract in a seven figure deal reportedly worth between $1.25 to $1.5 million.[10][11]</p>
